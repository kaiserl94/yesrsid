    <h1 class="narritive-title">Victorian Era</h1>
    <p class="narritive-description">
        Through the re-imagined space of the Victorian Era, Neologisms puts the accent on
        replacing textiles sourced from all over the world due to the growth of the global
        trade in the mid-1800s, with local, more accessible fabrics. The heavy, expensive
        curtains and upholstery of old were designed to last a lifetime but often employed
        materials, chemicals and manufacturing processes that produced considerable waste.
        The modern materials used in this project, in contrast, are locally-sourced and made
        of organic and recycled materials produced through non-toxic, chemical-free manufacturing
        processes which make them more sustainable but also reduces their lifespan.

            <h2>3D printed Thermoplastic polyurethane</h2>
            <p>
                After considering MIT’s most recent developments in the field of 3D printed fabrics, we chose to use a
                3D printed TPU for the walls of this design. The MIT researchers experimented with many materials until
                they discovered that basic TPU provides the best results. They created a very effective, flexible, and
                strong, but soft fabric.
                </br></br>Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) is rigid – making it easier to use for 3D printing. It’s
                durable and can retain its elasticity in the cold. TPU is degradable, non-toxic and made without the use
                of plasticizers. There is no DMF residue in the final products and the raw materials used in the
                production process can be recycled.

            <p>
                Knoll considers sustainability to be related to the decisions that shape the daily lives of the
                community. The design, manufacturing and management decisions Knoll makes are tightly connected with
                environmental, economic, and social factors.
                </br></br>Abacus upholstery resembles wool. However, it is made of 100 percent recycled polyester
                sourced from both post-consumer (soda bottles) and post-industrial (production scraps) materials. The
                products contain either 75% natural or bio-based materials, or a combination of pre and post-consumer
                recycled content making up at least 50% of its composition.

                Crate&Barrel produce eco-friendly products by minimizing petroleum-based foam and using more
                energy-efficient alternatives such as soy and corn-based foam and fibers, as well as partially recycled
                steel. The company uses a specialty facility that recycles all fiber and fabric remnants for alternative
                applications with no harmful liquid or solid waste.
                </br></br>Crate&Barrel Avery Linen Double Drum Pendant Light is made of linen which is one of the most
                environmentally sustainable fibers to produce. The flax used to make linen can be grown anywhere in the
                world, while the manufacturing process itself is simple, chemical-free and requires very little water.

            <p>
                Shaw Contract has been turning clear plastic bottles into carpet fiber for more than a decade. In 2003
                they found a way to incorporate harder-to-use green plastic bottles into some of their products and, in
                2019, produced a line of carpets that is 100% recyclable.
                </br></br>The Striation rug is a PVC-free carpet designed to be separated into component materials for
                carpet-to-carpet recycling. Each tile is labelled with a toll-free number that customers can call and
                arrange to have used tiles picked up for recycling.
